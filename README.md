# Brain-Tumor-Detector
This code detects brain tumors in MRI images using a pre-trained model. The user provides the image file path, and the image is processed to fit the model's input format. The model predicts whether a tumor is present, printing "No tumor detected" for 0 or "Tumor detected" for 1. It includes error handling for invalid image paths.
